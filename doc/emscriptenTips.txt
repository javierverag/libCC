- Functions must return a value to avoid exceptions (e.g bool functions must
  always return true or false)

- Sometime when generating the Makefile emscripten issues a warning:

  CMake Warning:
    Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:
  
      CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE

  The subsequent effect is that some of the toolchain file settings are
  ignored (surprisingly not all). Maybe the file is cached and and old version
  used. When functions like glfwCreateWindow are missing this is usually the
  case, as the setting to use glfw3 has been ignored, and this function is not
  available in glfw2.
